**Description of the problem**:
A smidgen of an old drawing of a scrollbar is left in the corner between horizontal and vertical scrollbars, if you change the Virtual Size in a wx.ScrolledCanvas window, and:
* there was only one scrollbar before
* the Virtual Size of the canvas is changed during runtime using SetVirtualSize() so that it is necessary to have two scrollbars

I'm willing to be told that there's something I can do about this, but because the visual artifact I'm seeing is outside of the Client Area, so I wasn't sure of a reliable way to blank it myself other than something hacky using wx.ScreenDC.  And it seems like something that ScrolledCanvas might be expected to take care of gracefully.

I'm also willing to be told that this is a wxWidgets issue and post there, but I wasn't sure.

```python
# Put code sample here
```
