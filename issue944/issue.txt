GraphicsContext does not work with AutoBufferedPaintDC

Operating system: macOS 10.13.6 and Windows 10 (both)
wxPython version: 4.0.3
Stock or custom build: Stock (pypi)
Python version: 3.6.6 (Windows), 3.7.0 (macOS)
Stock or custom build: Stock (Windows) Stock/homebrew (macOS)

Description of the problem:
I have an application where I draw a rectangle into a PaintDC using a
GraphicsContext.Create(paintdc) first.

This works perfectly fine with both PaintDC and BufferedPaintDC, but if I use
AutoBufferedPaintDC I see no drawing into the DC with the GraphicsContext.

I'm guessing this is related to recent activity implementing
AutoBufferedPaintDC as an overload for GraphicsContext.Create() (Issue #783,
Pull Request #874 ) I'm hoping that it might be a simple error in
implementation.

I don't have a small test case right now, but my code using GraphicsContext is
here: Line setting up PaintDC/AutoBufferedPaintDC Line using
GraphicsContext.Create
