Radio Toolbar Buttons behave as Toggle if Toolbar is Vertical

https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/850

Operating system: Macos 10.13.4
wxPython version: 4.0.1

Description of the problem:

Somehow radio buttons don't seem to work properly in a vertical toolbar.

In the following script, when the toolbar is created as a TB_HORIZONTAL
toolbar, the radio buttons behave as expected: i.e. a click on one button,
deselects another selected button.

However, when the toolbar is created as TB_VERTCIAL (by changing the TBFLAGS)
the buttons all misbehave, acting instead as toggle buttons.
